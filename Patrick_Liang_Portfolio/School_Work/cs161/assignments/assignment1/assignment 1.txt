Part 1:
In ___ years, you will be living in a house that is ______ square feet.
_____ feet under that house, you will find a box with a diamond worth _____ dollars.
_____ of your neighbors will try to steal it from you.

Part 2:
FortuneTeller.cpp:96:1: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token
 }

This error means that I am missing a semicolon somewhere after a line of code but before the curly braket.
To fix this error, simply find out where I am missing the semicoln and add it back in.

Part 3:
In 45 years, you will be living in a house that is 20 square feet.
17 feet under that house, you will find a box with a diamond worth 493038 dollars.
0 of your neighbors will try to steal it from you.

One thing I can improve on this program is the format of my code. This is my first time coding so I don't
exactly know if my coding format is correct. All I did was making it look clean and readable.
