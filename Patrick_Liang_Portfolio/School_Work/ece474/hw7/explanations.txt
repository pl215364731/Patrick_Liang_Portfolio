I was able to achieve 100% coverage but I felt the need to explain what I did since
post_input_data has the exact same data as input_data. In pre-coverage.rpt it was 
stated that 2 transitions are missing: SUBT -> DONE, SWAP -> DONE. These are not
transitions that can happen just by modifying the data. I added some code in the tb
to force a reset in SUBT and SWAP state in order to get coverage for those transitions.
